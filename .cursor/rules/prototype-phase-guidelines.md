# Prototype Phase Guidelines

We are currently in prototyping mode.

-   Develop frontend only; no backend integration.
-   Mock the interface; use static or dummy JSON for all data.
-   Link all components for navigation to demonstrate flow.
-   Ensure all buttons and UI controls are responsive.
-   Do not connect to backend logic.
-   Focus on design, UX, and component structure rather than production-quality architecture.
